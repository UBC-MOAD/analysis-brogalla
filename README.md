# Repository overview: 

- particle_tracking: using Ariane
	 - paper_Manuel --- contains notebooks used for paper
- Mn_model:
	- boundary_conditions --- based on global model of Mn from Marco van Hulten
	- initial_conditions --- also based on the global model of Mn
	- evaluation --- analysis of model results compared to Mn observations
	- testing --- analysis of runs used for testing of the Mn model functioning 
- Pb_model:
	- boundary_conditions --- based on a variety of observations
	- initial_conditions --- based on a variety of observations
	- evaluation --- analysis of model results compared to Pb observations
	- testing --- analysis of runs used for testing of the Pb model functioning
- forcing: 
	- rivers --- model rivers are classified based on their drainage basin and represented with characteristic tracer concentrations 
	- atmosphere --- dust and BC fields from CESM CAM-chem used as surface input of tracers
	- bio --- fields to quantify uptake and remineralization of Mn
	- scavenging --- use GEOTRACES observations to assess scavenging rates of Mn
- maps --- pretty maps of study region
